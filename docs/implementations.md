# Implementations

## Controllers
- [IOController](./implementations/iocontroller.md): A controller that takes simple text based user input and passes it to the board

## Boards
- [DenseBoard](./implementations/denseboard.md): A simple board that stores every value in the board in an array. Simple and easy, but does not scale well for large boards
