# Roadmap

- Create a factory for each interface
  - Can list all available implementations
  - Create an implementation from a string
  - Will require a factory implementation interface
- Create stdio controller
- Rebuild the default board into a dense board (every cell stored in memory)
- Implement the default rules of connect4 into a ruleset
- Create a sparse board (empty cells not stored, maybe some run length encoding) for storing *really* large boards
- ???
